# Wired Split Keyboard (NOT FINISHED)

A thin, USB-wired split keyboard designed for broad compatibility and easy customization.

## Overview
This keyboard is:
- Cross-compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD).
- Thin and low-profile for comfortable desk use.
- Wired (USB) for reliable, low-latency connection.
- Designed with Ergogen to generate layouts and firmware-ready sources.

A lightweight GUI-based layout/configuration application is planned for a future release to make remapping and layers easy for non-technical users.

## Features
- OS-agnostic: functions as a standard USB HID keyboard on any host.
- Ergonomic split layout to reduce strain and allow flexible hand positioning.
- Thin, minimal profile with a focus on portability and desk real estate.
- Ergogen-based design to allow reproducible, parametric layout changes.
- Firmware-friendly outputs to integrate with common open-source keyboard firmwares.

## Current Status
- Hardware design: prototyped with Ergogen.
- Wiring: USB-based connection between halves/host (implementation details in repository).
- Software: generic HID behavior available; GUI configurator is planned and will be released separately.

## Getting Started
1. Connect the keyboard to a computer via USB â€” it should enumerate as a standard keyboard.
2. Use your OS keyboard settings for basic remapping and modifier behavior.
3. For advanced customization, the repository includes Ergogen sources and firmware skeletons suitable for community firmwares (see the `ergogen/` folder).

(Developer note: detailed build and flashing instructions will be added as firmware and tooling are finalized.)

## Future Plans
- Official GUI configurator for layout and keymap management (cross-platform).
- Easy export/import of keymaps and one-click firmware generation.
- Prebuilt firmware images and step-by-step flashing guides for major platforms.
